        “Aaronn was fantastic to work with from start to finish. We were looking
        for a simple, stand-out logo and he delivered. I tried designing the
        logo myself thinking I wouldn’t need to pay the money for a professional
        graphic designer but I was very wrong. Working with Aaronn was worth
        every penny and was surprisingly affordable! I remember him saying
        simplicity is key to a successful logo and boy he was right. I can’t
        thank Aaronn enough for his effort and professionalism. I would
        recommend him to anyone looking for a design!”
